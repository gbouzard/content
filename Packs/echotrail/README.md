EchoTrail Insights data helps security analysts understand the big picture of how processes typically behave on Windows endpoints. This enables them to move faster, and with more efficiency, allowing them to make more informed decisions. We have been collecting data from hundreds of endpoints for years and our statistical model is built on millions of observed executions. In the world of Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), understanding the context of a detection is the crucial first step to making a decision to escalate or suppress an alert. EchoTrail insights give analysts that context that is typically only understood by the most senior analysts after years of experience. Our Insights data can be accessed directly via our free web search tool, or integrated into your SOAR or SIEM product for seamless access using our API.
