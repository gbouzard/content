  additionalinfo: 'If the record_execution field is set to false (the default), we will not store any statistical data about your execution and will only be able to provide a global score, limiting the power of the scoring API. However, if you set that field to true, we will record statistical data about that execution, and we will send you more nuanced results based not only on the global statistics, but also on those in your environment. The more you use the scoring API with record_execution set to true, the better your results get.'
